# Introduction #

Welcome to the wonderful world of open source software support!  You were sent to this page because it appears you don't have much experience with dealing with open source software support, and it's likely that you're going to leave without getting your question adequately answered.  You might even think we're being rude and dismissive towards you.

First, a word of warning.  You are likely to, at some point in reading this or during the process of getting support, think one of the following:

  * This does **NOT** apply to me.
  * This is too long, and I don't want to read it.
  * I don't have time for this.  ANSWER MY QUESTION!
  * I **deserve** better.  This support is horrible.

Please, finish reading this before you continue asking for support.  This is important!  This is like learning to use google properly - a skill that will benefit you long into the future.  **This is the secret way to get what you want with the minimum amount of effort.**

This may not reflect the attitude of all open source software developers or support personnel, but I have found it to be common among many that I have worked with.

# The Noob versus the Novice #

More than likely, if you're not getting the kind of support you want, it is because of your behavior.  Everyone starts somewhere, and if you need support, it's likely because you're new.  That's OK!  We were all new once.  However, there's a right way to be new at something, and a wrong way.  'Noobs' get it wrong, while 'Novices' get it right.  Let's go over some common behaviors:

## The Noob doesn't want to read, but the Novice searches for more to read ##

<pre>
noob>  HALP HOW DO I INSTALL?<br>
</pre>

Noobs come and ask questions without having done their part of the work.  Writing documentation (this included!) is work for us.  It's not generally the work we want to be doing.  However, we do it to save everyone (including our) time.  If we have to constantly repeat things in the manual, we're wasting our time writing it, and we're wasting our time re-writing it for every user that asks a question answered in it.

<pre>
novice>  I'm at step 7 in the install guide, but it fails with...<br>
</pre>

A novice knows that before asking a question, it is important to have searched for the answer themselves.  They read the manual, and if they can't find documentation, they ask for it.  They are ready to try new things and learn as they go.

## The Noob makes demands, but the Novice makes requests ##

<pre>
noob> I NEED HELP NOW.<br>
noob> When will my bugfix/new feature/new release be ready???<br>
noob> Why isn't anyone answering my question?<br>
</pre>

Noobs often feel entitled.  They feel entitled to free software on their terms, and they feel entitled to support that meets their needs when it doesn't work like they expect.  They want instant, easy, answers that work the first time.

Novices realize that they are making a request of someone else's time to help them with a problem.  They realize that producing and supporting software is a commitment.  They know that the ultimate burden for solving their problem is theirs, and noone else's.  They invest their own time before asking others to invest time.  They realize that all projects are imperfect, but they represent substantial investments in terms of time and energy.

## Noobs leech, but Novices seed ##

Noobs only take.  They show up when they need something, and then disappear when their needs are met.  Investing in a noob does little more than make them go away temporarily, only to return with more demands and ignorance later.

Novices realize that the people that are giving support are often users - just like them - who are giving back to the community.  They try to be respectful, and they try to give back when they can by answering questions, being social, and contributing.

## The Noob asks questions that are too general, but the Novice knows to provide detail ##

<pre>
noob>  It doesn't work.  I can't get it working.  Help.<br>
</pre>

The noob isn't willing to provide details about their problem.  This means that it is very difficult to extract the information needed to properly support them.  They are quick to blame the project when something goes wrong.

<pre>
novice> I just upgraded from 1.1 to 1.2, but I got error 423, and ...<br>
</pre>

The novice provides information that helps narrow down the field for where their error is.  They provide relevant details.  They have probably already googled or searched the support forums or the site to see if this is a problem that is already answered.  They realize that if there's a severe bug, it is likely in their setup or specific configuration rather than in the program itself.

## The Noob asks questions in the wrong place, or of the wrong people, but the Novice targets their questions to receive the best answers ##

The noob chooses too general a forum to look for support, or they pick wrong entirely.  A novice goes to the correct forum or channel and gets better support from people who are better informed about their specific situation. Doing some research and asking questions in the proper format in the proper venue is key to getting the answers you want.

# Why are people treating me like this?  Why won't they directly answer my question, or why are they being rude?  Shouldn't people on the forums, or in a chat session be there because they want to help? #

We like to help.  We spend all day helping sometimes.  However, when people act like noobs, and not like novices, it's disrespectful.  It's as if you're saying to everyone around you, "My problem is the most important, and my time is the most important."  This would be akin to storming into a restaurant, going straight to the counter, bypassing the line, and demanding food right this minute without paying.  That you are greeted with disrespect when you show disrespect should not be surprising.

Hopefully through this guide you have learned the basic skills you need to act more like a novice, and less like a noob.  Being new to something complex isn't a bad thing - but abusing the system while you're learning will only lead to unhappiness.
